## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.
I made an [exclusive repository](https://github.com/Eric-Philippe/Advent-Of-Code-2022) for the past one because I tried to make a challenge (Each day a new language).
This year I will just try to not overcomplicate things and just have fun, while completing the previous years.

## Behavior Driven Development

**This repository has been updated to use BDD.**

## How the repository is organized

On the `root` directory you will find two shell scripts:

- `new_day.sh`: This script will create a new subdirectory for the day and year you want to add. Like this it will automatically create the `input.txt` file and the `main.py` using the `template.py` file where you can find the template I use for each day.
- `run_all.sh`: This script will run all the days from a year you will specify in the CLI. It will run the `main.py` file in each subdirectory and print the result.

_Feel free to consult the `template.py` file to see how I structure my code, and to use the shell scripts if you want !_

## Python

I feel like Python is the best and easier language for me to solve these challenges. Simply ! (Also after the 2022 editions I just want to stick to one language >:) )

## Run time

| Year | Day |   Part 1   |   Part 2   |
| :--: | :-: | :--------: | :--------: |
| 2023 |  1  |  0.614ms   |  3.503ms   |
| 2023 |  2  |  0.911ms   |  0.755ms   |
| 2023 |  3  |  3.208ms   |  2.934ms   |
| 2023 |  4  |  0.779ms   |  0.904ms   |
| 2023 |  5  |  0.372ms   |  1.716ms   |
| 2023 |  6  |  0.142ms   |  0.033ms   |
| 2023 |  7  |  6.287ms   |  5.168ms   |
| 2023 |  8  |  3.533ms   |  15.069ms  |
| 2023 |  9  |  7.202ms   |  6.684ms   |
| 2023 | 10  | 1758.343ms | 1769.731ms |

**Note:** The run time is calculated using the full input file, the one provided in the repository is a cut down version of the original one in order to respect the AdventOfCode copy right about the input files.
